# Simple Markdown Editor

Fork of [jbt/markdown-editor](https://github.com/jbt/markdown-editor); all I've done is delete some chunks of code.

[Use it here](//aaronduino.github.io/simple-edit)

Feel free to take the code and copy it and modify it and use it however you like. (If you really want a licence, see [WTFPL](http://www.wtfpl.net/txt/copying/))
